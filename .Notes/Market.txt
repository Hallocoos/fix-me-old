Market

A market has a list of instruments that can be traded. When orders are received from brokers the market tries to execute it.
If the execution is successful, it updates the internal instrument list and sends the broker an `Executed` message.
If the order can't be met, the market sends a `Rejected` message.

The rules by which a market executes orders can be complex and you can play with them. This is why you build the simulator.
Some simple rules that you need to respect is that an order can't be executed if the instrument is not traded on the market or if the demanded quantity is not available (in case of Buy orders).
